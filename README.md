# NF_REQEXTRACTOR
Software Requirement Classification

## Description
This project is a text classification model to classify software requirements into different categories.
The model is trained on a dataset of software requirements with labels, and then predicts the label of a new requirement based on its text. The model uses a combination of tokenization, padding, and a neural network architecture consisting of an embedding layer, an LSTM layer, and a dense layer.
